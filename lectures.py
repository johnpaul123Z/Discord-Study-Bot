        "definition": "Parity bits are extra bits added to the key to ensure that the key has an odd number of 1s. They are used for error detection during key transmission but do not contribute to the actual security of the DES algorithm."

    {
        "term": "Key Expansion in DES",
        "definition": "In DES, the 56-bit key is expanded to generate 16 subkeys, one for each round. The key is first permuted and then divided into two halves, which are rotated and permuted in each round to produce the subkeys."
    },
    {
        "term": "Feistel Network in DES",
        "definition": "The Feistel network in DES is used to repeatedly transform the data during the 16 rounds. It splits the data into two halves, applies a key-dependent function to one half, and then combines them through XOR operations."
    },
    {
        "term": "S-box in DES",
        "definition": "The S-boxes in DES are substitution tables that replace bits in the data during the encryption process. They introduce non-linearity, making the encryption harder to reverse and enhancing the cipher's security."

    {
        "term": "Encryption and Decryption in DES",
        "definition": "In DES, encryption and decryption use the same process, but with the round keys applied in reverse order for decryption. The Feistel network ensures that each round alters the data using the round keys, providing strong security."
    },
    {
        "term": "Vulnerabilities of DES",
        "definition": "DES is vulnerable to brute-force attacks because its 56-bit key size allows for only 2^56 possible keys, which is small by modern standards. This makes it susceptible to exhaustive key search methods."
    },
    {
        "term": "AES",
        "definition": "AES is a block cipher that replaced DES due to its greater security and efficiency. It supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits and has a more robust design, making it resistant to brute-force and cryptanalytic attacks."
    },
    {
        "term": "Differences between AES and DES",
        "definition": "AES supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, with a block size of 128 bits. It has 10, 12, or 14 rounds, depending on the key size. In contrast, DES uses a 56-bit key, a 64-bit block size, and 16 rounds."
    },
    {
        "term": "Key Expansion in AES",
        "definition": "In AES, the key expansion process generates a series of round keys from the original key. The round keys are derived through a series of transformations, including substitution, permutation, and the application of the Rcon constant."

        "term": "IV's role in preventing patterns",
        "definition": "The IV introduces randomness to the encryption process, making it impossible to detect patterns in the ciphertext."
